# Future_Blink
 
A dynamic flowchart application built using the ReactFlow library. This project allows users to create and manage flowcharts with nodes for "Cold Email," "Wait/Delay," and "Lead Source." The flowchart can be saved to local storage, and emails are scheduled based on the "Wait/Delay" nodes and the save timestamp.

Features
Dynamic Node Creation:

Add nodes for "Cold Email," "Wait/Delay," and "Lead Source."
Connect nodes to define a workflow.
Node Management:

Remove individual nodes along with their connected edges.
Save Flowchart:

Save the current flowchart (nodes and edges) to localStorage.
Data includes node details, connections, and a timestamp.
ReactFlow Integration:

Visualize and interact with the flowchart using the ReactFlow library.
Includes additional features like a minimap, zoom controls, and a background grid.
Technologies Used
React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
ReactFlow: Library for building interactive flowcharts and diagrams.
